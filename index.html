        <h4> About me</h4>
        <p> Hello my name is Maya. I am currently a senior in high school. I am in the proccess of learning how to code. But, when I have more experience, I will be doing website development for others.
        I know html, css, and a little bit of python. I also love physics. After high school, I hope to attend a Liberal Arts College and obtain a degree in physics. When I graduate college, I will get my
        Ph.D. Eventually, I would love to work at a univeristy or NASA. Outside my academic interests, I am passionate about my city: Detroit. 
   I  volunteer at the local cancer hospital and at a camp for young children. I am also working on a Girl Scout gold award project that will get 
   elementary school girls more involved science. </p>
