     <span id="hey"> Hey! I'm Maya. I am currently a high school senior with aspirations of becoming a physicist. Currently, I am in the proccess of learning how to code. 
      When I am more skilled I will be designing websites for pay. For now, I will be doing websites for family and friends for 
      a low cost. <br><br>
      
       I am involved in other engineering activities besides coding. I partcipate in Shell Eco Marathon and OCCRA robotics with my school. I also love to be involved in my city: Detroit. I volunteer at the a cancer hospital, the library, and the <a href="http://www.summerinthecity.com/">Summer in the City.</a> 
      I am currently in the process of planning a program at Duffield Elementary School that exposes 5th grade girls to science. This ties in to my passion of helping black girls more involved in STEM (Science, 
      Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). <br> <br>
      
       I am also a huge geek! I love to read comics and watching marvel movies/tv shows. I am really excited for the Black Panther movie and Season 2 of Jessica Jones. It is my dream to go Comic Con 
      International in San Diego (along with Lollapalooza Music Festival). </span>
