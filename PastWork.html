   <p> HTML and CSS are the programming languages used to build websites. A website is similar to the human body. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as
   the bones and vital organs of a website. The text and images and all the aspects that keep the website "alive" are put here. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the websites skin. 
   It covers up the guts and makes the website pretty! You can resize images, change font size and color through CSS.
